# CryptojackingDetection
A cryptoajcking detection tool.

**Overview**
The Cryptojacking Detection System is a Python-based tool designed to monitor and detect potential cryptojacking activities on a system. It checks for unusually high CPU and memory usage that could be indicative of unauthorized cryptocurrency mining operations. The tool specifically identifies known mining processes and logs relevant information for further analysis.

**Features**
Real-time Monitoring: Continuously checks the system's CPU and memory usage to identify potential cryptojacking.
Logging: Logs detailed information about suspicious processes, including process names, PID, CPU usage, and memory usage.
Known Mining Process Detection: Includes a predefined list of known crypto-mining process names and provides alerts if any are detected.
